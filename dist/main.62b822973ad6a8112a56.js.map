sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,...\\n    )\\n  },\\n  ...\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n结合了eval和source-map的特点，eval将每个模块包起来，并且最后添加source-map的base64信息，可以知道行列，可以为模块缓存它可以更快的重建SourceMaps。\\n\\n\\n\\n### cheap-source-map\\n\\n不包含列信息，不包含 loader 的 sourcemap，（譬如 babel 的 sourcemap）\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n不包含行信息，会减小map大小，不支持loader的sourcemap，比如从jsx映射到js，最终你只能访问到js文件，看不了源码的jsx文件。\\n\\n\\n\\n### cheap-module-source-map\\n\\n不包含列信息，同时 loader 的 sourcemap 也被简化为只包含对应行的。最终的 sourcemap 只有一份，它是 webpack 对 loader 生成的 sourcemap 进行简化，然后再次生成的。\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n相较于cheap-source-map，可以支持loader的sourcemap\\n\\n\\n\\n### hidden-source-map\\n\\n和 source-map 一样，但不会在 bundle 末尾追加注释.\\n\\n##### 形式：\\n\\n```javascript\\nwebpackJsonp([1],[\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  ...\\n])\\n```\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n与 source-map 相比少了末尾的注释，但 output 目录下的 `index.js.map` 没有少\\n\\n\\n\\n> 注1：webpack 不仅支持这 7 种，而且它们还是可以任意组合上面的 eval、inline、hidden 关键字，就如文档所说，你可以设置 souremap 选项为 cheap-module-inline-source-map。\\n>\\n> 注2：如果你的 modules 里面已经包含了 SourceMaps ，你需要用 [source-map-loader](https://github.com/webpack/source-map-loader)来和合并生成一个新的 SourceMaps \\n\\n\\n\\n## 调试\\n\\ngithub上关于调试的问题：[Source Maps don't work on Chrome](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2145)\\n\\n##### 个人实测：\\n\\nchrome里能否调试源码  x：不行  o：可以\\n\\neval-source-map  x(断点被忽略)\\n\\ncheap-source-map  x(不是源码)\\n\\ncheap-module-eval-source-map x(断点被忽略)\\n\\ncheap-module-source-map  o\\n\\nsource-map  o\\n\\ninline-source-map o\\n\\n\\n\\n### 总结\\n\\neval： 更快\\n\\ninline：内联\\n\\ncheap：不含列信息，不支持loader sourcemap（譬如 babel 的 sourcemap，从jsx到js的映射）\\n\\ncheap-module：不含列信息，支持loader sourcemap\\n\\nsource-map：包含行列信息，支持loader sourcemap\\n\\n\\n\\n##### 开发环境推荐：\\n\\n- cheap-module-eval-source-map(不可调试，但是更快)\\n- cheap-module-source-map(可调试，慢一点)\\n\\n理由：只要知道具体的行数基本就能定位错误，cheap，eval可以加快重新编译的速度\\n\\n\\n\\n##### 生产环境推荐：\\n\\n- cheap-module-source-map(不含列信息)\\n- source-map(含列信息)\\n\\n理由: eval, inline会内联导致文件过大，cheap包含的信息太少，cheap-module，source-map最合适生产环境\\n\\n\\n\\n(￣▽￣)\\\"以上，如有错误，欢迎指正。\\n\"\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 190 */\n/***/

`src/main.js`\\n\\n做为入口文件，我们当然会把所有要用到的都给引入进来。\\n\\n引入router很简单，创建一个VueRouter的实例，最重要的两个参数一个就是路由模式，一个就是路由配置(见下)，创建好以后，扔到Vue实例的配置中就行，最终路由的所有相关信息都会挂在`this.$router`上，组件可以通过`this.$router`直接访问。\\n\\n```javascript\\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();  //es6 promise\\nrequire('isomorphic-fetch');  //fetch库\\n\\nimport Vue from 'vue';\\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router';\\nimport routes from './route-config.js';\\t//路由配置\\nimport store from './store/index.js';\\t//store\\nimport App from './views/App.vue';\\t//页面容器\\n\\nVue.use(VueRouter);\\t//vue使用veux，vue-router 都是通过Vue这个对象上的use这个方法。\\n\\n//创建路由\\nconst router = new VueRouter({\\n  mode: 'hash',\\t//路由的模式\\n  routes\\n});\\n\\n//将store, router加入并生成应用\\nnew Vue({\\n  el: '#application',\\n  store,\\n  router,\\n  render: h => h(App)\\n});\\n```\\n\\n##### `src/route-config.js`\\n\\n路由配置也很简单，文档有详细的例子。如果应用过大，打包到一个js文件里有点不合适，我们可以在这里引入页面的时候做页面的懒加载，就是code spliting。[懒加载例子](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/advanced/lazy-loading.html)\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport HomePage from './views/HomePage.vue';\\t//引入页面\\nimport CounterPage from './views/CounterPage.vue';\\n\\n//当然真正应用的路由不会这么简单，vue-router也提供动态路由，嵌套路由等等，详见vue-router文档\\nexport default [\\n  { path: '/', component: HomePage },\\n  { path: '/counter', component: CounterPage}\\n];\\n```\\n\\n##### `src/store/index.js`\\n\\n同使用vue-router一样，先调一下use方法，然后新建一个Store实例，把state，actions，getters，mutations全扔进去。\\n\\n最终将store抛出，会被用在新建vue实例的时候。同样store的所有相关会挂在this.$store上，组件可以通过this.$store直接访问。\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Vue from 'vue';\\nimport Vuex from 'vuex';\\nimport actions from './actions/index.js';\\nimport mutations from './mutations/index.js';\\nimport * as getters from './getters/index.js';\\n\\nVue.use(Vuex);\\n\\n//state\\nconst state = {\\n  count: 0,\\t//counter actions 操作的值\\n  pageData: {}\\t//fetch action 操作的值\\n};\\n\\n//把上面的融到一起\\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\\n  state,\\n  actions,\\n  getters,\\n  mutations\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n##### `src/views/App.vue`\\n\\n```vue\\n<style lang=\\\"sass\\\" src=\\\"../style/app.scss\\\"></style>\\n\\n<template lang=\\\"html\\\">\\n  <div id=\\\"app\\\">\\n    <!--你也可以在其他地方使用<router-view></router-view>来创建嵌套路由，详见vue-router文档-->\\n    <router-view></router-view>\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\n### 总结\\n\\n看到这里，各位聪明的看官，一定已经知道如何把vue，vuex，vue-router串联起来了。\\n\\nvue的官方文档很全，也出了中文文档，而且vue的设计思路清晰，应用的结构也比较简单明了，所以上手vue不是一件很难的事情。\\n\\n分享一波文档地址：\\n\\n[vue](https://vuefe.cn/)\\t\\t[vuex](https://vuefe.cn/vuex/)\\t[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/)\\n\\n最后各位别忘了github右上角点波关注,

sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,...\\n    )\\n  },  \\n  function(module,exports,__webpack_require__){\\n    eval(\\n      ...\\n      //# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,...\\n    )\\n  },\\n  ...\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n结合了eval和source-map的特点，eval将每个模块包起来，并且最后添加source-map的base64信息，可以知道行列，可以为模块缓存它可以更快的重建SourceMaps。\\n\\n\\n\\n### cheap-source-map\\n\\n不包含列信息，不包含 loader 的 sourcemap，（譬如 babel 的 sourcemap）\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n不包含行信息，会减小map大小，不支持loader的sourcemap，比如从jsx映射到js，最终你只能访问到js文件，看不了源码的jsx文件。\\n\\n\\n\\n### cheap-module-source-map\\n\\n不包含列信息，同时 loader 的 sourcemap 也被简化为只包含对应行的。最终的 sourcemap 只有一份，它是 webpack 对 loader 生成的 sourcemap 进行简化，然后再次生成的。\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n相较于cheap-source-map，可以支持loader的sourcemap\\n\\n\\n\\n### hidden-source-map\\n\\n和 source-map 一样，但不会在 bundle 末尾追加注释.\\n\\n##### 形式：\\n\\n```javascript\\nwebpackJsonp([1],[\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  function(e,t,i){...},\\n  ...\\n])\\n```\\n\\n##### 特点：\\n\\n与 source-map 相比少了末尾的注释，但 output 目录下的 `index.js.map` 没有少\\n\\n\\n\\n> 注1：webpack 不仅支持这 7 种，而且它们还是可以任意组合上面的 eval、inline、hidden 关键字，就如文档所说，你可以设置 souremap 选项为 cheap-module-inline-source-map。\\n>\\n> 注2：如果你的 modules 里面已经包含了 SourceMaps ，你需要用 [source-map-loader](https://github.com/webpack/source-map-loader)来和合并生成一个新的 SourceMaps \\n\\n\\n\\n## 调试\\n\\ngithub上关于调试的问题：[Source Maps don't work on Chrome](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2145)\\n\\n##### 个人实测：\\n\\nchrome里能否调试源码  x：不行  o：可以\\n\\neval-source-map  x(断点被忽略)\\n\\ncheap-source-map  x(不是源码)\\n\\ncheap-module-eval-source-map x(断点被忽略)\\n\\ncheap-module-source-map  o\\n\\nsource-map  o\\n\\ninline-source-map o\\n\\n\\n\\n### 总结\\n\\neval： 更快\\n\\ninline：内联\\n\\ncheap：不含列信息，不支持loader sourcemap（譬如 babel 的 sourcemap，从jsx到js的映射）\\n\\ncheap-module：不含列信息，支持loader sourcemap\\n\\nsource-map：包含行列信息，支持loader sourcemap\\n\\n\\n\\n##### 开发环境推荐：\\n\\n- cheap-module-eval-source-map(不可调试，但是更快)\\n- cheap-module-source-map(可调试，慢一点)\\n\\n理由：只要知道具体的行数基本就能定位错误，cheap，eval可以加快重新编译的速度\\n\\n\\n\\n##### 生产环境推荐：\\n\\n- cheap-module-source-map(不含列信息)\\n- source-map(含列信息)\\n\\n理由: eval, inline会内联导致文件过大，cheap包含的信息太少，cheap-module，source-map最合适生产环境\\n\\n\\n\\n(￣▽￣)\\\"以上，如有错误，欢迎指正。\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n//

`src/main.js`\\n\\n做为入口文件，我们当然会把所有要用到的都给引入进来。\\n\\n引入router很简单，创建一个VueRouter的实例，最重要的两个参数一个就是路由模式，一个就是路由配置(见下)，创建好以后，扔到Vue实例的配置中就行，最终路由的所有相关信息都会挂在`this.$router`上，组件可以通过`this.$router`直接访问。\\n\\n```javascript\\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();  //es6 promise\\nrequire('isomorphic-fetch');  //fetch库\\n\\nimport Vue from 'vue';\\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router';\\nimport routes from './route-config.js';\\t//路由配置\\nimport store from './store/index.js';\\t//store\\nimport App from './views/App.vue';\\t//页面容器\\n\\nVue.use(VueRouter);\\t//vue使用veux，vue-router 都是通过Vue这个对象上的use这个方法。\\n\\n//创建路由\\nconst router = new VueRouter({\\n  mode: 'hash',\\t//路由的模式\\n  routes\\n});\\n\\n//将store, router加入并生成应用\\nnew Vue({\\n  el: '#application',\\n  store,\\n  router,\\n  render: h => h(App)\\n});\\n```\\n\\n##### `src/route-config.js`\\n\\n路由配置也很简单，文档有详细的例子。如果应用过大，打包到一个js文件里有点不合适，我们可以在这里引入页面的时候做页面的懒加载，就是code spliting。[懒加载例子](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/advanced/lazy-loading.html)\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport HomePage from './views/HomePage.vue';\\t//引入页面\\nimport CounterPage from './views/CounterPage.vue';\\n\\n//当然真正应用的路由不会这么简单，vue-router也提供动态路由，嵌套路由等等，详见vue-router文档\\nexport default [\\n  { path: '/', component: HomePage },\\n  { path: '/counter', component: CounterPage}\\n];\\n```\\n\\n##### `src/store/index.js`\\n\\n同使用vue-router一样，先调一下use方法，然后新建一个Store实例，把state，actions，getters，mutations全扔进去。\\n\\n最终将store抛出，会被用在新建vue实例的时候。同样store的所有相关会挂在this.$store上，组件可以通过this.$store直接访问。\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Vue from 'vue';\\nimport Vuex from 'vuex';\\nimport actions from './actions/index.js';\\nimport mutations from './mutations/index.js';\\nimport * as getters from './getters/index.js';\\n\\nVue.use(Vuex);\\n\\n//state\\nconst state = {\\n  count: 0,\\t//counter actions 操作的值\\n  pageData: {}\\t//fetch action 操作的值\\n};\\n\\n//把上面的融到一起\\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\\n  state,\\n  actions,\\n  getters,\\n  mutations\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n##### `src/views/App.vue`\\n\\n```vue\\n<style lang=\\\"sass\\\" src=\\\"../style/app.scss\\\"></style>\\n\\n<template lang=\\\"html\\\">\\n  <div id=\\\"app\\\">\\n    <!--你也可以在其他地方使用<router-view></router-view>来创建嵌套路由，详见vue-router文档-->\\n    <router-view></router-view>\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\n### 总结\\n\\n看到这里，各位聪明的看官，一定已经知道如何把vue，vuex，vue-router串联起来了。\\n\\nvue的官方文档很全，也出了中文文档，而且vue的设计思路清晰，应用的结构也比较简单明了，所以上手vue不是一件很难的事情。\\n\\n分享一波文档地址：\\n\\n[vue](https://vuefe.cn/)\\t\\t[vuex](https://vuefe.cn/vuex/)\\t[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/)\\n\\n最后各位别忘了github右上角点波关注,
